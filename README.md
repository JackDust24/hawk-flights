## IN PROGRESS

A flight search application using Next.js and Node. 

This is not a production app and is using mock data

## OVERVIEW

More details to follow soon on this repo. This is not yet finished at of 19th August 2024 and to view.

A lot of the UI hasn't been done (yes aware the home screen looks so 1985!) and security, authorisation and other pages unfinished, which will be done over the next couple of days

## TECH STACK

This is build with Next.js for the frontend, with server actions used for intereacting with the Node.js backend.

Not using a real payment gateway, just a fake payment intent
